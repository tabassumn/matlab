# matlab for ChE
Codes developed for Chemical engineering calculations.

Currently files include activity coefficients (gamma) and fugacity coefficients (phi) calculations for binary upto quaternary components. Gamma calc based on UNIFAC method, while phi calc make use of the virial EOS.

UNIFAC paramaters are from the original table by Hansen H.K., Rasmussen P., Fredenslund A., Schiller M., Gmehling J., "Vapor-Liquid Equilibria by UNIFAC Group-Contribution. 5. Revision and Extension", Ind.Eng.Chem.Res., 30(10), 2352-2355, 1991.

Critical Properties and Acentric Factors are based on the work by C. L. Yaws and P. K. Narasimhan, “Critical properties and acentric factor—organic compounds,” in Thermophysical properties of chemicals and hydrocarbons, Elsevier, 2009, pp. 1–95.
